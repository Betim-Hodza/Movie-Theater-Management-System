# Movie Theater Management System

Simulates a movie theater terminal that has a queue of customers waiting to be seated to watch their showing
This implements stacks, queues, Binary Search Trees, and Linked Lists!

## Description

- This program goes through what a movie theater system would work, there is a queue with customers waiting and then the program asks the user to input zip for theater location.
- which then is using Binary Search Trees to find the theater.
- The program loads in the theater map with file reading, the user picks their seat and the file is written as the seat has been taken. 
- The users receipt is then stored in a stack and can be popped anytime, the users receipt information is also a linked list as that's how it stores all the data.
